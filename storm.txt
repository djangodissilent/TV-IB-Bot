Hi Mai, Reaching out for a follow up on my cohort application

When we talked last time I was upset because my application was rejected, However since then I've adopted a growth mindset and started to work on my soft skills alongside my technical ones

I started working as a part-time software engineer on UpWork which gave me the chance to work with different clients and teams from all over the world and on interesting projects that advanced my technical skills, ranging from creating High-frequency trading software to recently being hired by Amazon (AWS) as a backend and DevOps engineer to test their Lightsail servers and provide feedback.

I believe that I've tremendously improved my soft skills especially my communication and negotiation skills & recently I've been awarded the Top-Rated status from UpWork as a software engineer, which is awarded to the top 5% of professionals in their fields. I hope that this will improve my chances in joining the next cohort as I intend to continue growing and reaching out for higher goals.

I feel that I've grown a fair amount in this short span of time and part of that is due to your honest feedback, So thanks!

Cheers, 

- Ahmed Rslan
